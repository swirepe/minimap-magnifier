This application magnifies a section of your screen.  Run it next to Starcaft to get yourself a bigger minimap.

With the window in focus, use (w) (a) (s) (d) to control what part of the screen is magnified.  Hold shift with these keys for finer control.  To zoom, use the (+) or (-) keys.

If you don't like it, consider modifying the code.  It was written in Processing 1.2.1, but uses Java's Robot class to make the screen captures.
